### What I learned

In this project I had the opportunity to test my JavaScript skills, and I learned:

- Create unit tests that allow testing the operation of the form and the creation of the logic of the functions.

- Use and understand the "addEventListener" method:

  ```js
  submit.addEventListener("click", submitFormData);
  ```

- Add classes to HTML elements from JavaScript.

- Cancel any default action of the submit button with "event.preventDefault":

  ```js
  function submitFormData(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
  ```

- Unique responsibility by function.
